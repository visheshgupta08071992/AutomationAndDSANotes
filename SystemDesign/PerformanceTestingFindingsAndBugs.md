# Performance Testing Findings and Fixes

This document summarizes the key issues identified during performance testing and the corresponding fixes implemented over the past year.

---

## 1. Application Becoming Unresponsive (503 Service Unavailable Error)
- **Issue**: The application returned a 503 Service Unavailable error when it could not handle the incoming load.
- **Fix**: Scale the application pods to handle the load. For example:
  - If the application is currently configured with 10 pods, try scaling to 14 pods.
  - Validate whether the application can handle the load without 503 errors after scaling.

## 2. JDBC Connection Failures
- **Issue**: JDBC connection failures occurred under high load when the application failed to acquire database connections.
- **Fix**: Implement connection pooling with the following configurations:
  - Set a minimum number of idle connections.
  - Configure the maximum number of connections based on expected application load.
  - This avoids the expensive process of repeatedly opening and closing new database connections.

## 3. Slowness of the Application
- **Issue**: The application performed well with low user counts but exhibited slowness under heavy load. Performance testing was used to identify the load threshold at which slowness began.
- **Fix**:
  1. **Scale Application Pods**: Increase the number of pods to handle higher user loads.
  2. **Database Performance Optimization**:
     - Analyze slow queries using tools like SQL profiles and optimize them.
     - Ensure proper indexing of commonly queried columns.
     - Implement **data partitioning** to improve performance for large tables.
     - Use **caching** to reduce repetitive database queries.

## 4. Deadlocks Observed During High Concurrency
- **Issue**: Deadlocks occurred when two users attempted to update the same resource simultaneously under high concurrency.
- **Fix**: Implement a proper locking mechanism to prevent simultaneous updates to the same resource.

---

## 5. Memory Leaks
- **Issue**: Memory consumption increased over time under high concurrency, eventually causing crashes. 
  - In one scenario, an API that loaded large amounts of data failed with a `400 Bad Request` error under high concurrency. Root cause analysis revealed that the temporary memory used by the API was completely consumed.
- **Fix**:
  - Optimize memory usage by reviewing the API's memory allocation logic.
  - Ensure proper memory release after operations are complete.
  - Consider implementing pagination or limiting the data size loaded by the API.

---

## 6. Race Condition Leading to Database Exceptions
- **Issue**: The application logs revealed that the client was sending identical POST requests concurrently, leading to race conditions and database exceptions.
- **Fix**: Instruct the client to avoid sending identical concurrent POST requests. Concurrently identical requests caused race conditions and database procedure exceptions.
