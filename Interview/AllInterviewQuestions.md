Newfold Digital recent SDET interview experience

The interview consisted of three rigorous technical rounds, each lasting approximately 2‚Äì2.5 hours. Here's a detailed experience

Each round focused on evaluating problem-solving, coding, and automation testing (UI and API) expertise. Asked a total of four coding questions, alongside questions on Selenium, Java, and testing concepts.

1st coding question :
Move all negative numbers to beginning and positive maintaining order
(need to cover all the test cases with time and space complexity)
 ex: Input: -12, 11, -13, -5, 6, -7, 5, -3, -6
 Output: -12 -13 -5 -7 -3 -6 11 6 5

2nd coding questions:
Reverse a string preserving space position
(need to cover all the test cases with time and space complexity)
