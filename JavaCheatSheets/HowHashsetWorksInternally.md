### What is a HashSet?
A `HashSet` is a collection that implements the `Set` interface, backed by a `HashMap`. It does not allow duplicate elements and does not maintain any particular order of the elements. The underlying mechanism of `HashSet` is based on hashing, which involves using the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods to store and retrieve elements efficiently.

### Internal Structure
- A `HashSet` internally uses a `HashMap` to store its elements. Each element in the `HashSet` is stored as a key in the `HashMap`, with a constant dummy value (often `PRESENT`).
- The key feature of `HashSet` is its speed in adding, removing, and checking for the presence of elements, which are all `O(1)` operations on average.

### How HashSet Works Internally
1. **Adding an Element**:
   - When you add an element to a `HashSet`, Java internally calls the `hashCode()` method of the object to compute the hash code.
   - The hash code is then used to determine the bucket (an index in the internal array) where the object should be placed.
   - If no other element is in that bucket, the element is added directly.
   - If another element is already in that bucket (a hash collision), Java uses the `equals()` method to check if the new element is equal to the existing one.
     - If they are equal, the new element is not added (since `HashSet` does not allow duplicates).
     - If they are not equal, the new element is stored in a linked list or tree structure within the same bucket.

2. **Checking for Element Presence**:
   - When you check if an element exists in the `HashSet` (using `contains()`), the `hashCode()` of the element is calculated to find the appropriate bucket.
   - Then, the `equals()` method is used to compare the element with others in that bucket to see if it exists.

3. **Removing an Element**:
   - The removal process is similar to the addition process. The `hashCode()` is used to find the bucket, and then `equals()` is used to locate and remove the element from the `HashSet`.

### Example

Let's look at an example to illustrate how this works:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Objects;

class Person {
    String firstName;
    String lastName;

    Person(String firstName, String lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) {
            return true;
        }
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
            return false;
        }
        Person person = (Person) obj;
        return firstName.equals(person.firstName) &&
               lastName.equals(person.lastName);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(firstName, lastName);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return firstName + " " + lastName;
    }
}

public class HashSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashSet<Person> people = new HashSet<>();

        Person p1 = new Person("John", "Doe");
        Person p2 = new Person("Jane", "Doe");
        Person p3 = new Person("John", "Doe");

        people.add(p1);
        people.add(p2);
        people.add(p3); // This will not be added because p3 equals p1

        for (Person p : people) {
            System.out.println(p);
        }
    }
}
```

### What Happens Internally?
1. **Adding p1**:
   - `p1.hashCode()` is computed.
   - The hash code determines a bucket in the `HashSet`'s internal array.
   - Since the bucket is empty, `p1` is added.

2. **Adding p2**:
   - `p2.hashCode()` is computed.
   - The hash code determines a different bucket.
   - Since the bucket is empty, `p2` is added.

3. **Adding p3**:
   - `p3.hashCode()` is computed. Since `p3` has the same `firstName` and `lastName` as `p1`, `p3.hashCode()` will be the same as `p1.hashCode()`.
   - The same bucket as `p1` is found.
   - The `equals()` method is called to compare `p3` and `p1`, and since they are equal, `p3` is not added.

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Hash Code Distribution**: A good `hashCode()` method ensures that the objects are evenly distributed across the buckets, minimizing collisions and optimizing performance.
- **Hash Collisions**: Even if two objects have the same hash code, they might not be equal (`equals()` method). Handling collisions is crucial for the performance of a `HashSet`.
- **Efficiency**: The average time complexity for basic operations like add, remove, and contains is `O(1)` because of the efficient hashing mechanism.

This is how a `HashSet` in Java works internally, relying on the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods to manage the uniqueness of elements efficiently.
