## Understanding Scala

Scala stands for Scalable language. Scala is compatible with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows it to seamlessly interoperate with Java libraries and frameworks. You can use Java and Scala together in the same project. Scala provides built-in support for concurrent and parallel programming using features like actors and the Akka framework and is much faster then Java,Ruby,NodeJs and Python.
