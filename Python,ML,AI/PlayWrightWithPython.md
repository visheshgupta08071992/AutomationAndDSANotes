## Understanding Playwright with Python


**Why Playwright?**  

Playwright is a powerful automation tool for web testing and browser automation.

1. **Multi-Language Support:** Playwright supports JavaScript, Python, C#, and Java.
2. **Web & API Testing:** Designed for both web and API testing

3. **Multi-Browser & OS Compatibility:** It supports major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit, across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

4. **Automatic Waiting Mechanism:** Playwright automatically waits for elements to be actionable, reducing test flakiness and avoiding manual wait commands.

5. **Inbuilt Logging and Screenshots:** It provides built-in logs and screenshot capabilities, aiding in debugging and capturing detailed trace data for failures.



In the Python ecosystem,pytest serves as a testing framework that allows us to execute Playwright tests using the playwright-pytest plugin. It is similar to TestNg in Java.
