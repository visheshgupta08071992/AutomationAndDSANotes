## Understanding Numpy

### Basics of Numpy

Numpy in a Numerical Python package used majorly for scientific computation in Python. Numpy provides support for arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### Advantage of Using Arrays

1. Numpy uses much less memory to store data. Numpy Arrays can only store data of same Type while Python list allows storing data of different types.
2. Numpy makes it extremely easy to perform mathematical operations on it while mathematical operations are difficult to perform with List.
3. Numpy Used for the creation of n-dimensional arrays.
4. In python Lists one can have nested data with different size, while the same cannot be done in array
   **eg**
   
   ```python
   
   ```
