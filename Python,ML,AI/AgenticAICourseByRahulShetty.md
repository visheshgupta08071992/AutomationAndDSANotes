**What is LLM** - A Large Lanuguage Model is an AI system trained on large set of data capable of understanding and generating human like language for diverse tasks.

**What is AI Agents and how it is different from LLM**

Imagine you need to apply for a passport.

One way is to **search on Google** or **ask an LLM** about the process. You’ll get the steps, documents required, and where to apply. But after gathering this knowledge, **you still need to do all the work yourself**—filling forms, submitting documents, and following up.

Now, consider using a **passport agent**. The agent already knows the entire process. Instead of you doing everything, the agent **handles the application on your behalf**—submitting forms, coordinating with the office, and delivering the passport to you. Your effort is minimal, and the task gets done.

This is similar to how **AI Agents** work. Instead of just providing information, AI Agents can **act on your behalf** using their knowledge and tools.

* A **Personal Assistant Agent** might compare prices and book a flight for you.
* A **Code Agent** could debug and fix issues in your repository.
* A **Data Analyst Agent** might automatically generate your monthly sales report.

In short: **LLMs give you the knowledge, but AI Agents use that knowledge to get the job done.**

## Understanding MCP

MCP is Model Context Protocol which is a Standardized way for AI agents to connect to and use external tools and services.
