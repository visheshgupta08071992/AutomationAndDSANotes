# Python Interview Questions

**1. What is the difference between a list and a tuple?**

```python
# Lists are mutable, tuples are imutable

eg.
list = [1,2,3]
list[0] = 100
print(list) #[100,2,3]

tuple = (1,2,3)
tuple[0] = 100 # Given operation is not supported and would result in TypeError with message tuple object does not support item assignment while running the program
print(tuple) #Error would be thrown

```
